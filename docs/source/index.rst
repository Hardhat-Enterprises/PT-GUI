Deakin Detonator Toolkit (DDT) is a toolkit that aims to simplify the penetration testing experience and workflow. 
The toolkit was initially started as a Command Line Interface (CLI) toolkit with a few minor tools. 
This Trimester, DDT has been further developed to now have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with several new attack vectors and tools added.
